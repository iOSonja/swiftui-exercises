# 100 Days of SwiftUI

My solutions to Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course. The challenge is to make small iOS apps built using Apple's SwiftUI framework.

The course consists of three different types of exercises:
- Checkpoints – small coding tasks for practicing the Swift language
- Projects – SwiftUI apps that are combinations of tutorial-based MVP:s and improvements made by me
- Challenges – Apps I've build from scratch
